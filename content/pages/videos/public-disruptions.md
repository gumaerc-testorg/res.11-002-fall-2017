In this video, Carpenter offers a live demonstration of the portable water filter press he and his students have developed. He reviews how activists have used these types of low-cost water filters around the world to help communities get access to clean water. Carpenter also presents his use of live demos as a form of public pedagogy to encourage learner engagement. This video will be of interest to socially-engaged artists, art educators, and those with an interest in global access to clean water.
