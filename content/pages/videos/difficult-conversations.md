In this video, Carpenter provides an introduction to social practice and socially engaged art, explained both through literature and through real world examples. He then narrows in on both “reading in public spaces” and “reading public spaces” as disruptive interventions. This video will be particularly interesting to artists, art educators, and social activists.
