In this video, Carpenter focuses on how educators can disrupt traditional pedagogical models to engage learners with social issues and lived experience. He uses a group activity to demonstrate how curriculum development is a political act that involves choosing not only what is included, but what is excluded. This video will be of particular interest to art educators and curriculum developers.
